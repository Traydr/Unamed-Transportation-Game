# Unamed-Transportation-Game
These are the files for my A-Level project 'Unamed Transportation Game', where the user is a truck driver delivering goods from shops to cities trying to make a profit.

Unity version currently used: 2019.4.15f1
When you have downloaded the ZIP file, unpack it into a folder. Rename the folde "Unamed Transportation Game". 
Then put it in C:\Users\ <Your Username> \Documents\Unity projects\Unamed Transportation Game

Should work then.
